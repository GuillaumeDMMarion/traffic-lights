	"""
	Description: 
		A SUMO simulation is run with a single traffic light system to be optimized. 
		The goal is to end with a minimized disutility of accumulated delay.
		The goal is achieved by choosing the next phase each 3 seconds interval.

	Observation:
		A position and speed matrix of all the vehicles currently approaching the traffic light system.
		An array indicating the phase for which the next action will have an impact on, plus its history.

	Actions:
		4 discrete actions indicating the desired next phase.

	Reward:
		The negative difference between the previous disutility of accumulated delay and subsequent disutility of accumulated delay for all vehicles near the intersection, over a 3 seconds interval.
	
	Starting State:
		A zero-car position & speed matrix, and a (faulty) zero-phase array (solved/redefined at the start of the first step).

	Episode Termination:
		At the end_time if given, else when all the routes are depleted.
